# God Bless Git

A POSIX compatible script to extract some informations about a git repository.

God Bless Git (GBG) is a shell tool which can extract repository informations in a
simple and readable format. Thus, you can know:

 * Repository informations: is the folder a git repository, which is the top folder, etc.
 * Head informations: is head detached, head hash, branch, tag
 * Workspace informations: are there and how many modified/deleted/untracked/ignored files
 * Index informations: are there and how many added/modified/moved/deleted files
 * Remote informations: is upstream declared, how many commits differ, etc.

This list will grow with time. Priorities goes to:

  - Merge type: merge or rebase
  - Current action: merge, rebase, bissect, etc.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
See [deployment][] for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

God Bless Git as few prerequisites.

First one is [git][] which is required.
You can install it with your distribution package manager (apt, yum, pacman, etc.) or compile it yourself (look [git website][git]).

Then, GBG rely on system utilities as `sed`, `grep`, `cut`, etc.
These should be already install on most of the POSIX systems.
If not, then you probably have a very custom system and so must be skilled enough to install them.

There is some optional dependencies.
On the one side, for code linting.
We rely on [ShellCheck][] and [Bashate][] to warn us about the coding style.
Just check their respective pages to know how to install them (nothing really complicated).
On the other side, for testing.
Here we rely on [shUnit2][].
However, it is automatically installed the first time you run the tests, and so you do not have to install it manually.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running

First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AlexisBRENON/god-bless-git.git
```

Then, source the init script:

```sh
. god-bless-git/init.sh
```

That's it.
You know have a `gbg_git_info` function declared which will populate GBG's variables (see [deployment][]) each time you call it.

To see it at work, move to a non git repository folder (like `/tmp`) and run:

```sh
cd /tmp
gbg_git_info
set | grep -aE '^gbg_'
```

Here is the sample output:

```
gbg_git_info=''
gbg_head_branch=''
gbg_head_hash=''
gbg_head_is_detached=''
gbg_head_is_on_tag=''
gbg_head_tag=''
gbg_index_additions_num=''
gbg_index_deletions_num=''
gbg_index_has_additions=''
gbg_index_has_deletions=''
gbg_index_has_modifications=''
gbg_index_has_moves=''
gbg_index_modifications_num=''
gbg_index_moves_num=''
gbg_is_a_git_repo=false
gbg_repo_git_dir=''
gbg_repo_has_stashes=''
gbg_repo_just_init=''
gbg_repo_stashes_num=''
gbg_repo_top_level=''
gbg_upstream_commits_ahead_num=''
gbg_upstream_commits_behind_num=''
gbg_upstream_has_commits_ahead=''
gbg_upstream_has_commits_behind=''
gbg_upstream_has_diverged=''
gbg_upstream_has_upstream=''
gbg_upstream_name=''
gbg_workspace_deletions_num=''
gbg_workspace_has_deletions=''
gbg_workspace_has_ignored=''
gbg_workspace_has_modifications=''
gbg_workspace_has_untracked=''
gbg_workspace_ignored_num=''
gbg_workspace_modifications_num=''
gbg_workspace_untracked_num=''
```

Then move back to the `god_bless_git` folder and run again the previous commands:

```sh
cd god_bless_git
gbg_git_info
set | grep -aE '^gbg_'
```

Here again is the sample output (which can be different from yours):

```
gbg_git_info=''
gbg_head_branch=master
gbg_head_hash=5543d924a41f33b045b5317291d3df0e4b76eee0
gbg_head_is_detached=false
gbg_head_is_on_tag=false
gbg_head_tag=''
gbg_index_additions_num=0
gbg_index_deletions_num=0
gbg_index_has_additions=false
gbg_index_has_deletions=false
gbg_index_has_modifications=false
gbg_index_has_moves=false
gbg_index_modifications_num=0
gbg_index_moves_num=0
gbg_is_a_git_repo=true
gbg_repo_git_dir=/home/jovyan/god-bless-git/.git
gbg_repo_has_stashes=false
gbg_repo_just_init=false
gbg_repo_stashes_num=0
gbg_repo_top_level=/home/jovyan/god-bless-git
gbg_upstream_commits_ahead_num=0
gbg_upstream_commits_behind_num=0
gbg_upstream_has_commits_ahead=false
gbg_upstream_has_commits_behind=false
gbg_upstream_has_diverged=false
gbg_upstream_has_upstream=true
gbg_upstream_name=origin/master
gbg_workspace_deletions_num=0
gbg_workspace_has_deletions=false
gbg_workspace_has_ignored=true
gbg_workspace_has_modifications=false
gbg_workspace_has_untracked=true
gbg_workspace_ignored_num=2
gbg_workspace_modifications_num=0
gbg_workspace_untracked_num=1
```

## Running the tests

Some tests are distributed alongside the source code.
While, one day, they will be executed on a continuous integration server, you can still run them locally.

### Functional tests

These ones test that Gob Bless Git behave as expected, i.e. that the right variables are defined correctly.
You can run all of them using the following command:

```sh
make functionnal-tests
```

You can also run only one with:

```sh
make tests/functionnal/<test_type>_test.sh
```

### Profiling tests

GBG also comes with a profiling test, checking that execution time is not excessive.
You can execute it with:

```sh
make profile
```

### Coding style tests

As explained in the [prerequisites][] part, we rely on [ShellCheck][] and [Bashate][] to lint the code.
You can run these both linting checkers on the whole code base with the following command:

```sh
make lint
```

## <a name="deployment"></a>Deployment

Currently, the only way to deploy GBG is to clone the repository somewhere (like `~/.local/share/gbg`) and add the following line to your shell RC file:

```sh
. ~/.local/share/gbg/init.sh
```

## Built With

* [ShellCheck][], a static analysis tool for shell scripts.
* [Bashate][] - Code style enforcement for bash programs.
* [shUnit2][], a xUnit based unit test framework for Bourne based shell scripts.
* [README-Template.md](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2), a template to make good `README.md`.
